- Data flow and decision-making process
- Agent coordination model
- Tool integration architecture
- Memory and context management

**Tone:** Architectural, conceptual, system-focused.

---

### 3. Technology Stack
**Purpose:** Transparently document all technologies used, organized by category.

**Content:**
- AI Models (LLMs, embeddings, etc.)
- APIs and Services
- Infrastructure (databases, queues, etc.)
- Orchestration and Automation
- Frontend Technologies
- Desktop Control Libraries

**Format:** For each technology:
- Name
- Category
- Purpose in SHAIL
- Reason for Selection

**Tone:** Factual, transparent, non-proprietary.

---

### 4. Open-Source Credits & Acknowledgements
**Purpose:** Legally and ethically credit all open-source dependencies.

**Content:**
- Clear separation of open-source vs proprietary
- Library and framework credits
- License acknowledgements (where relevant)
- How each open-source tool benefits SHAIL

**Tone:** Respectful, transparent, grateful.

---

### 5. How to Use SHAIL (Conceptual Workflow)
**Purpose:** Explain how users think and work with SHAIL, not UI instructions.

**Content:**
- Intent → Execution → Memory workflow
- How SHAIL assists decision-making
- Tool coordination and agent selection
- Approval and safety workflows
- Context awareness and memory

**Tone:** Conceptual, workflow-focused, user-centric.

---

### 6. Data, Memory & Context Awareness
**Purpose:** Explain how SHAIL remembers, learns, and maintains context.

**Content:**
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
- Short-term vs long-term memory
- Context retrieval and usage
- Data storage and privacy
- Memory architecture

**Tone:** Technical but accessible, privacy-conscious.

---

### 7. Security, Privacy & Transparency
**Purpose:** Build trust through transparency about data handling and security.

**Content:**
- Data collection and storage
- Privacy guarantees
- Security measures
- Approval workflows for sensitive operations
- Audit logging
- User control over data

**Tone:** Transparent, security-focused, user-empowering.

---

### 8. Roadmap & Evolution (High-Level)
**Purpose:** Communicate future direction without overpromising.

**Content:**
- Current capabilities (what's working now)
- Planned enhancements (high-level, not detailed)
- Integration roadmap
- Evolution philosophy
- How SHAIL improves over time

**Tone:** Honest, forward-looking, realistic.

## Documentation Principles

1. **Technical Honesty:** No overselling, no fluff, no unverified claims.
2. **Transparency:** Clear about what's open-source, what's proprietary, what's planned.
3. **Maintainability:** Written for long-term maintenance and updates.
4. **Accessibility:** Technical but accessible to engineers and technical stakeholders.
5. **Credibility:** Builds trust through accuracy and transparency.

## Content Format

- Markdown files for easy maintenance
- Each section as a separate file
- Consistent heading structure
- Code examples only where necessary for clarity
- No UI screenshots or step-by-step tutorials
